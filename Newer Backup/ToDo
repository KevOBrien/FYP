- Feature correlations mean anything?
- Sentiment calculation
- Trading simulation algo
- Weight features?
- 3 vs 5 vs 10 day predictions

- Normalise tickers collectivley or individually?
- Cyclical learning rate vs (if loss < learningRate * 10) vs (if loss < learningRate)
- Presentation simulation
- Overfits training time period (even for unseen ticker)- poor on future period
- Optimal dropout
- Optimal batchSize
- Predict more than 1 day (use predictions for further predicting)
