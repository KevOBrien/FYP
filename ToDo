* Test acc/loss of:
    - Prices alone
    - Prices + technicals
    - Prices + sentiment
    - Prices + technicals + sentiment

- Normalise tickers collectivley or individually?
- Normalise everything to [0, 1]? (pct_change, etc.)
- Cyclical learning rate vs (if loss < learningRate * 10) vs (if loss < learningRate)
- Predict up/down vs actual price vs ma
    - [1, 1, 0, 0] vs [1, 0, 0, 0]
- Presentation simulation
- Overfits time period - poor on future period
- TensorFlow bug?
- Optimal dropout
- Optimal batchSize
- Test difference in features created (moving average & percent change)
- Predict more than 1 day (use predictions for further predicting)
